# thinner
<img src="/res/slogan.png">

### Goal
- We have web standard style property **'scrollbar-width'** but every websites doesn't use it.
- I feel very ashamed since just giving 'thin' prop makes ux much more elegant.
- I tried to change **EVERY SINGLE SCROLLBARS THIN** with firefox add-on.

### Warnings
- Since this add-on touches after website load, this could effect on website purchases or protected protocols.
- Many things are subject to change.
